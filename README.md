 Live Volatile Data Acquisition & Integrity Verification (VM Forensics)

 ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates forensically sound volatile data acquisition and integrity verification performed entirely within a Virtual Machine (VM) environment. The goal was to execute a live system triage by capturing critical volatile artifacts (System Memory/RAM) and non-volatile artifacts (Registry Hives) without relying on external physical media (USB).

This approach ensures rapid, forensically sound data collection, linking core Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics principles to a Criminology context.

Evidence Integrity: All acquired evidence was hashed using FTK Imager and verified for integrity, confirming "No bad blocks found in image"*. The hash values shown above were computed upon creation and verified upon archiving.
Chain of Custody: Detailed in the accompanying Evidence_Manifest.pdf.
